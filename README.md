# python-assistant

first I started with a simplified code snippet that demonstrates the implementation of a few features, such as greeting the user, answering general knowledge questions, and providing weather information.
Then I created a basic user interface using the Tkinter library in Python.
I created a basic window using tk.Tk(). Inside the window, I added an entry widget (tk.Entry()) to allow the user to input their question. I also created a button (tk.Button()) with the label "Ask" and linked it to the handle_button_click() function using the command parameter.
When the user clicks the button, the handle_button_click() function is called. This function retrieves the user's question from the entry widget, calls the answer_question() function to get the answer, and displays the answer using a message box (messagebox.showinfo()).
To add voice recognition and speech synthesis capabilities to my AI assistant using Python, I used libraries such as SpeechRecognition for voice recognition and pyttsx3 for speech synthesis.
I used the SpeechRecognition library to recognize speech input from the user. I initialized the recognizer using sr.Recognizer() and use recognize_google() to convert the recorded audio into text.
For speech synthesis, I utilized the pyttsx3 library. I initialized the speech synthesizer using pyttsx3.init() and used the say() and runAndWait() functions to convert the response text into speech and play it.
